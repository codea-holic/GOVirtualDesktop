# Virtual Desktop Environment Using GO and Fyne

Hello Reader. If you have clicked this you must be fascinated to know about how to make a Virtual Environment or how to use one for yourself. In this project I have created a basic and simple Virtual Desktop using **GO Language** and **FYNE Module**.

## Introduction

**GO** is a statically typed, compiled programming language designed at Google by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson. Go is syntactically similar to C, but with memory safety, garbage collection, structural typing, and CSP-style concurrency. The language is often referred to as Golang because of its domain name, golang.org, but the proper name is Go. *[(Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(programming_language))*

**Fyne** is a free and open-source cross-platform widget toolkit for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs) across desktop and mobile platforms. Fyne uses OpenGL to provide cross-platform graphics. It is inspired by the principles of Material Design to create applications that look and behave consistently across all platforms. It is licensed under the terms of the 3-clause BSD License, supporting the creation of free and proprietary applications. In December 2019 Fyne became the most popular GUI toolkit for Go, by GitHub star count and in early February 2020 it was trending as #1 project in GitHub trending ranks.[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fyne_(software))
